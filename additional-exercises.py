##### square_number #####

# Create a function called 'square_number'. 

# It accepts one number as an argument. 

# It returns the number squared.

##### sum_list #####

# Create a function called 'sum_list'. 

# It accepts a list of numbers as an argument (for example [1,2,3]). 

# It returns the sum of all the numbers inside the list (the return from the example would be 6).

##### farenheit_to_celcius #####

# Create a function called 'farenheit_to_celcius'. 

# It accepts a number as an argument which represents a temperature in farenheit. 

# It returns the temperature in celsius. You will have to look up the math to convert it.

# If the number is a float, round down to the nearest whole number.

##### is_planet #####

# Create a function called 'is_planet'. 

# It accepts a string as an argument. 

# If that string is a planet in our solar system ('Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', etc.) return True and otherwise return False.

# This ought to work regardless of capitalization and whitespace.

##### is_palindrome #####

# Create a function called 'is_palindrome'. 

# It accepts a string as an argument. 

# If the string is a palindrome (it's the same forward as backwards) then return True, otherwise return False. An example of a palindrome is 'abba' or 'radar'.

# As an additional challenge the function ignores white space so something like 'taco cat' would also be considered a palindrome.
